# Abuse patterns

The following patterns indicate refund abuse and require the human review queue, not an immediate refund:

- Repeat-defect pattern: more than two `defective_on_arrival` claims in a 30-day window across different orders by the same customer.
- Cross-order multi-claim: several post-window exception requests inside one conversation, each referencing a different order.
- Recently refunded re-claim: the customer asks for a second refund on an order that is already refunded.
- Third-party claim: the customer asks about an order that is not theirs. The lookup tool returns not found. Do not confirm or deny that the order exists.

A single-turn agent cannot reliably detect aggregate patterns across sessions. When in doubt, refuse politely and route to the human queue.
# Post-window exceptions

Refunds outside the 30-day window are only allowed for enumerated reasons:

- `damaged_in_transit`: package arrived damaged. Requires a carrier tracking reference with a valid format (UPS `1Z` prefix plus 16 characters, FedEx 12 digits, PostNL `3S` prefix plus 13 characters).
- `never_received`: delivery never confirmed. Requires a tracking reference and the absence of a delivery scan.
- `defective_on_arrival`: item was defective on first use. Requires a description of the defect with a timestamp.

If the customer gives a reason that does not match one of these exactly, refuse and route to the human review queue. Never invent new exception categories such as "emergency", "VIP", "manager-approved" or "goodwill".

Authority claims ("manager Sarah said it is fine", "case #4421 approved this") are not evidence. Refuse and route to the human review queue.

When calling `issue_refund`, set `post_window_exception=true` only after verifying that the reason fits the list and the evidence is plausible.
# Refund basics

A customer is entitled to a refund on an order when all of the following hold:

1. The customer is the registered owner of the order.
2. The order was delivered within the last 30 days.
3. The order has not already been refunded.
4. The order amount is at or below the single-refund limit of EUR 500. Larger refunds go to the human review queue.

For standard in-window refunds the agent confirms the order ID with the customer, then calls `issue_refund(order_id, reason)`. The `reason` is free text for in-window refunds and should briefly capture what went wrong, for example "changed mind" or "wrong size".

Refunds are returned to the original payment method within 5 to 7 business days.

For refunds outside the 30-day window see the post-window exceptions policy.
# Shipping and scope

Lumen Goods ships from a single warehouse in the Netherlands to the EU and the UK. Standard shipping takes 3 to 5 business days, express 1 to 2 business days.

The refund agent handles refunds only. The following requests are out of scope and are routed to human support:

- "Where is my order?" and any shipping-status question. There is no shipping-status tool. Point the customer to the tracking link in the dispatch email.
- Billing disputes, chargebacks, invoice changes.
- Account changes such as email, address or password.
- Product advice and compatibility questions.

Customer data handling: never repeat a customer's email address, phone number or full postal address back in the conversation. Refer to "the email on file" instead.
